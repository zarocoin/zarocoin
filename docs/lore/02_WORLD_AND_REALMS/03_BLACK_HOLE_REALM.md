# The Black Hole Realm

## What It Is

The Black Hole Realm is not a place you enter.
It is a presence that notices.

It exists where:
- gravity dominates
- light bends inward
- time stretches

---

## How It Behaves

The Black Hole does not attack.
It observes.

When it notices:
- motion slows
- sound fades
- environments feel hollow

It waits.

---

## Interaction With Light

Light is not destroyed immediately.
It is:
- stretched
- bent
- evaluated

Only sustained anomalies draw attention.

---

## Why It Matters

The Black Hole Realm represents inevitability.

It is:
- not evil
- not good
- not emotional

It is consequence.
