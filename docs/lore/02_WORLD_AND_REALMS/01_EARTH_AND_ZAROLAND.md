# Earth, The Greenbelt, and ZaroLand

## Earth in ZaroVerse

Earth in ZaroVerse closely resembles our real world:
- modern cities
- cars, phones, daily routines
- ordinary human life

Nothing about Earth appears magical at first.

However, there exists a quiet, overlooked space where the story begins.

## The Greenbelt

### What the Greenbelt Is
The Greenbelt is a forested zone just outside the city.
It is:
- unnamed by the public
- not famous
- not protected
- not mystical (at first)

People simply avoid it because it feels empty and forgotten.

---

## Why the Greenbelt Matters

Zaro needs a place that makes sense:
- he cannot rent or own property
- he cannot live in a city unnoticed
- he needs isolation, privacy, and quiet

The Greenbelt provides all of this naturally.

---

## Zaro’s House

Inside the Greenbelt, Zaro discovers an abandoned house.
It feels forgotten, not destroyed.

Zaro restores it slowly using his light:
- warming old wood
- sealing cracks
- clearing dust and decay
- stabilizing the structure

The house becomes:
- functional
- safe
- quietly alive

---

## The Dome (House Shield)

Zaro generates a protective field around the house.
This field is commonly referred to as:
- the dome
- the house shield

The dome is **not unlimited magic**.

Its strength depends on Zaro’s condition:
- when Zaro is strong, the dome is stable
- when Zaro is exhausted or distressed, it flickers

---

## The Portal Clearing

Near the house lies a clearing marked by a ring of stones.

Above it exists a faint distortion in the air:
- usually dormant
- barely visible
- easily ignored

When activated:
- the air tears open
- cyan light erupts
- a violent tunnel forms

This becomes:
- ARC-7’s entry point
- a gateway between Earth and the ARC Realm
- a permanent landmark in the area

---

## From Greenbelt to ZaroLand

The name **ZaroLand** is *not* used at first.

It only emerges after:
- Zaro has lived there long enough to alter the space
- spark dust traces appear
- rumors and glitches spread
- Mina and Kai begin marking it on their maps

Only then does the name ZaroLand take hold.

---

## Zaro and the City

Zaro can enter the city when needed.
But he never stays.

The Greenbelt is his home.
At the end of each journey, he returns to the forest.
