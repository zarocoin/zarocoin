# The ARC Realm and The Veil

## The ARC Realm

The ARC Realm exists beyond Earth.
It is not a fantasy world.

It is:
- structured
- monitored
- governed by rules
- optimized for observation and containment

Nothing there is organic by default.

## ARC-7’s Origin

ARC-7 originates from the ARC Realm.
It was created to:
- observe anomalies
- seal breaches
- preserve balance

ARC units do not rule.
They monitor.

## The Veil

The Veil is the boundary between realms.

It is not a wall.
It is a layered threshold.

The Veil:
- resists passage
- distorts perception
- requires activation to cross

Crossing it always has consequences.

## Breaches and Tears

When the Veil is damaged:
- space folds
- light fractures
- energy leaks into nearby reality

The portal near Zaro’s home is one such scar.

## Why the ARC Realm Watches Earth

Earth is not special.
It is unstable.

ARC systems detect:
- emerging primes
- unsanctioned energy behavior
- reality distortions

Zaro triggers all three.
