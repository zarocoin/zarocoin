# MemeWars Training System

MemeWars is how the team trains without breaking reality.

Training is shown through action, not lectures.

---

## ARC-7 Training Philosophy

ARC-7 trains like a system:
- measure performance
- repeat drills
- increase difficulty
- expose limits safely

There are no speeches.
Only tests.

---

## Zaro Training

### Goal
Zaro learns to control his spark without burning out.

### Focus Areas
- steady glow under pressure
- small controlled bursts
- stopping power on command
- holding shields without shaking
- mental focus during fear

Overdrive is trained carefully.
Power without control is failure.

## Mina Training

### Goal
Mina becomes reliable under chaos.

### Focus Areas
- swarm scanning
- path lighting
- air pocket creation
- contamination clearing
- formation control under interference

Mina is not support.
She is command.

---

## Kai Training

### Goal
Kai learns to build fast and hold structures under stress.

### Focus Areas
- rapid construction
- holding under impact
- instant release and rebuild
- managing tool heat and stamina

Heavy actions exist,
but patience matters more than force.

---

## Teamwork Drills

- Kai opens paths
- Mina scouts and relays
- Zaro protects and advances
- ARC-7 monitors and seals

MemeWars rewards coordination, not solo power.

## Why MemeWars Matters

MemeWars is not filler.

It:
- sharpens the team
- reveals limits
- seeds future gameplay
- hides secrets for observant fans
