# MemeWars Arenas

Each MemeWars arena is designed like a fighting game stage.

They are memorable, readable, and atmospheric.

## Core Arena Rules

### Clear Fight Floor
- clean silhouettes
- strong contrast
- minimal clutter in combat space

### Deep Background Atmosphere
- fog, rain, steam, sparks
- slow environmental motion
- dramatic lighting

### Sound Identity
Each arena has a distinct sound mood:
- hums
- pressure
- echoes
- distortion

Sound matters as much as visuals.

They do **not** replace core lore names.

Mood words may overlap.
Canon names remain locked.
