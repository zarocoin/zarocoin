# MemeWars Arena

## What MemeWars Is

MemeWars is a **virtual training arena** used by the team to prepare for real threats.

It is not a toy.
It is not a game inside the story.

It is a controlled combat simulation.

## Origin

- ARC-7 created the base system as a sterile simulation.
- He referred to it simply as **The Sim**.
- Mina and Kai later modified it:
  - added visual identity
  - added sound and atmosphere
  - added stage personality

They renamed it proudly:

**MEMEWARS ARENA**

## Purpose

MemeWars exists to:
- train control
- test limits
- practice teamwork
- push stamina safely

Mistakes here do not destroy the real world.

## Tone Rules (Canon Locked)

- No bright or cheerful environments
- No cute forests or sunny skies
- No comedic danger

MemeWars must feel:
- intense
- pressurized
- game-like
- slightly hostile

## Long-Term Role

MemeWars is designed so that:
- story arenas can become real game stages
- moves can translate into mechanics
- secrets can be hidden in environments

It is a bridge between:
story → game → community
