# Names and Terms (Canon Lock)

All names in ZaroVerse are **intentional**.  
Nothing is named arbitrarily.

## Naming Principles

- Names emerge from **function, behavior, or consequence**
- Names are discovered, not assigned
- Once established, names do not casually change

## Capitalization Rules

- Proper nouns are always capitalized
- Systems, realms, and entities retain consistent spelling
- No alternate spellings for stylistic purposes

## Term Stability

- If a term exists in canon, it must be reused consistently
- New terms must not conflict with existing ones
- Slang may exist in-world, but canon text remains precise

## Prohibited Practices

- Retconning names without narrative justification
- Introducing synonyms to “freshen” language
- Renaming entities for marketing reasons

Names are anchors.  
Changing them destabilizes the universe.
