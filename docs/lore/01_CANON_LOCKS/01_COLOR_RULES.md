# Color Rules (Canon Lock)

Color in ZaroVerse is **not aesthetic decoration**.  
It is **semantic**, **energetic**, and **canonical**.

Colors represent states, roles, and system-level truths.

## Core Principles

- A character or system’s **primary color does not change casually**
- Color changes only occur through **earned narrative events**
- No character may freely swap color identity

## Canonical Color Meaning

### Yellow
- Represents **origin energy**
- Associated with emergence, spark, and catalytic presence
- Zaro’s core color

### Cyan
- Represents **control, observation, and system intelligence**
- Associated with ARC entities and monitoring constructs

### Magenta
- Represents **interference, anomaly, or deviation**
- Appears only during unstable or transitional events

### Black / Void
- Represents **absence, corruption, or collapse**
- Never portrayed as neutral

## Forbidden Usage

- No random recoloring for style
- No multicolor “power-up” effects unless explicitly canon-approved
- No rainbow or spectrum blending without narrative cause

Color is lore.  
Breaking color rules breaks canon.
