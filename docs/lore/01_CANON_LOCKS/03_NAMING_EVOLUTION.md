# Naming Evolution Rules (Canon Lock)

Names in ZaroVerse may **evolve**, but never arbitrarily.

## How Names Change

A name may evolve only when:
- The function of the entity changes
- The perception of the entity changes
- The role of the entity is redefined by consequence

## Evolution Pattern

1. Descriptive Phase  
2. Shortened Usage  
3. Canon Consolidation  

Once consolidated, the name is locked.

## What Is Not Allowed

- Marketing-driven renames
- Cosmetic renaming for tone
- Multiple coexisting “official” names

## Narrative Weight

Name evolution is treated as:
- A recorded event
- A signal of growth or fracture
- A canon milestone

Names carry history.  
History is not rewritten lightly.
