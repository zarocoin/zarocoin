# MemeWars Rules (Canon Lock)

MemeWars is a **contained training realm**, not chaos.

## Purpose of MemeWars

- Stress-testing ideas
- Training reactions
- Controlled absurdity

## Rules of Engagement

- Events inside MemeWars do not automatically affect core canon
- Characters retain identity but operate under loosened constraints
- Outcomes are symbolic unless elevated to canon explicitly

## Tone Rules

- Humor is allowed
- Mockery is allowed
- Nihilism is not allowed

## Canon Boundary

MemeWars content becomes canon only when:
- Referenced outside MemeWars
- Affects a locked system
- Leaves a persistent mark

MemeWars is play —  
but play with rules.
