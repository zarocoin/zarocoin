# Dome and Boundary Rules (Canon Lock)

Zaro’s Dome is not a shield.  
It is a **boundary system**.

## Core Function

- Separates stable reality from hostile external forces
- Regulates energy flow, not force alone
- Operates continuously, not reactively

## Boundary Behavior

- The Dome does not expand infinitely
- It does not activate on command
- It responds to existential thresholds

## Failure Conditions

The Dome may weaken if:
- Overextended
- Exposed to sustained anomaly
- Internally compromised

## What the Dome Is Not

- Not a weapon
- Not a cure-all
- Not permanent

The Dome protects —  
but protection has cost.
