# ZaroVerse — Tone & Rating Guide (v2.0)

## Target Audience
- Primary: **10+ to 35**
- Secondary: families, parents watching with kids
- Global audience

## Rating Goal
- Safe for **10+**
- Dark and intense, but **no gore** and **no cruelty-for-shock**

## Core Tone
- Wonder + tension + emotional resilience
- Smart sci-fi fantasy (no dumb shortcuts)

## What We Avoid
- Infinite powers
- Random “friendship magic” with no mechanism
- Cheap exposition dumps
- Gore, body horror, torture themes

## What We Want
- Clear rules
- Strategic solutions
- Emotional moments that trigger real consequences
- Visual identity that is iconic: **Yellow / Cyan / Green / desaturation / wet-static**

## Threat Tone

Cosmic fungus should feel like:
- mold infecting life
- smoke that thinks
- patient, inevitable

It is creepy, not comedic.  
It is intelligent, not random.

## Writing Style
- Keep it cinematic
- Keep it honest
- Keep it rule-based
- Keep it emotional without being childish

ZaroVerse respects the audience. It never insults intelligence.
