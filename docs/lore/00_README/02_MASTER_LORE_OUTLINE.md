# ZaroVerse — Master Lore Outline (v2.0)

This is the high-level roadmap for creators.  
It is simple but complete.

## 1) The Worlds

There are four major “Prime realms”:

- **Earth**: the collision point (Season 1 starts here)
- **ARC Realm (Cyan Prime)**: ARC guardians and systems
- **Yellow Origin** (Zaro’s unknown home): teased slowly
- **Black Hole Realm (Black Prime)**: source of darkness and fungus

## 2) The Prime Forces (CMYK)

- **Yellow Prime (Zaro)** = light, protection, restoration, emotion, persistence
- **Cyan Prime (ARC-7)** = logic, scanning, containment, systems discipline
- **Magenta Prime (future)** = unknown, teased end Season 1, introduced later
- **Black Prime (Black Hole)** = consumes light, cannot create it, drives fungus

## 3) Season 1 (This Season)

### Act 1: Arrival + Foundation
- The container impacts
- Spark Dust detonates
- Zaro condenses into form
- Early rules are established: limits, costs, and the nature of the threat

### Act 2: Escalation
- The fungus pressure increases
- ARC-7’s discipline and rules become central to the conflict
- Zaro’s strength grows — but costs rise too

### Act 3: Signal + Consequence
- A major signal event forces attention from higher systems
- The Black Hole’s awareness sharpens
- Magenta Prime is teased, not explained

## 4) The Visual Identity

ZaroVerse has a strong, iconic palette system:
- **Yellow / Cyan / Green**
- **Desaturation**
- “Wet static” atmosphere and tension

The world should feel:
- Wonder + tension + resilience
- Smart sci-fi fantasy (no dumb shortcuts)

## 5) Creator Rule

Every power must have:
- A mechanism  
- A cost  
- A limit  

No infinite powers. No plot-armor shortcuts.
