## Title
**ZAROVERSE — SEASON 1**

## Logline
A teenage light-being named **Zaro** crashes onto Earth carrying a mysterious **Seed Core**.

- Hidden details and layered worldbuilding across episodes.

## Main Cast

- **ARC-7 (Cyan Prime)**: logical guardian AI bound by rules and consequences.

## The Threat
A living cosmic fungus that hunts energy and hope.  
It spreads patiently and intelligently — like mold that learned strategy.
