# ZaroVerse — Canon Snapshot (1 Page) v2.0

## Season

- This is **Season 1** (official public season).

## Core Theme

> **“Don’t let the light go out.”**  
Light is hope, energy, and life. It can be protected, drained, restored, and combined.

## The 4 Prime Forces (CMYK)

ZaroVerse is built on a **CMYK Prime system**, like four fundamental “Prime frequencies.”

### **Y = Yellow Prime: ZARO**
- A living light-being that condensed into a physical form on Earth.
- Protective, restorative, emotional, and determined.
- Has limits. Using light drains him (**Glow Burn**).

### **C = Cyan Prime: ARC-7**
- A logical guardian from a separate realm (the ARC Realm).
- Teal/Cyan energy, scans and containment.
- Follows strict rules. Breaking rules has consequences.

### **M = Magenta Prime (teased end of Season 1)**
- A new Prime that will be revealed in the story arc.
- Teased late in Season 1 and properly introduced later.

### **K = Black Prime: The Black Hole**
- Consumes light; cannot create it.
- Drives the cosmic fungus and darkness pressure across realms.

## The Threat

The enemy presence is a **living cosmic fungus**:
- Like mold infecting life
- Like smoke that thinks
- Patient, creeping, inevitable

It doesn’t “fight fair.” It **hunts light**.

## The Arrival Rule (Canon)

Zaro’s arrival happens in this order:
1) The **container impacts** first  
2) **Spark Dust** explodes outward  
3) Zaro **condenses into form** afterward  

This sequence is canon and must remain consistent.

## Season 1 Direction (high level)

Season 1 begins on **Earth**, where the collision happens.  
ARC-7 watches from above through strict rules — until Zaro’s signal forces a choice that affects multiple realms.
