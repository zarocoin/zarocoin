# ZaroVerse — Start Here (v2.0)

Welcome to the **ZaroVerse Canon Pack**.

This folder explains:
- What ZaroVerse is
- What must NEVER be changed
- The tone and rating rules
- A simple Season 1 overview (public-safe)

## Important New Canon (v2.0)

- This is **Season 1** (not Season 0).
- The main villain source is called **THE BLACK HOLE** (not “Void”).
- The universe is built on **CMYK Prime physics** (4 Prime forces).
- The threat is a living **cosmic fungus** (smoke/mold/spores). No “magic ink drawings.”
- Zaro arrives after impact: **container hits first**, **Spark Dust explodes**, then **Zaro condenses into form**.

## How to use this pack

1) Read **CANON_SNAPSHOT_1PAGE** first.  
2) Read the “do not change” rules (kept private internally).  
3) Use **MASTER_LORE_OUTLINE** as the roadmap.  
4) Use **TONE & RATING GUIDE** to keep the universe consistent.  
5) Use the **Season 1 Public Pitch** whenever you need a public-facing explanation.

## What is ZaroVerse?

ZaroVerse is a rules-driven sci-fi fantasy universe built on **four Prime forces** (CMYK).  
It’s designed to respect the audience: **no infinite powers**, **no lazy shortcuts**, and **every win has a cost**.

Core theme:

> **Don’t let the light go out.**

Light is hope, energy, and life. It can be protected, drained, restored, and combined.

## Public vs Deep Lore

- This folder contains **public-safe canon** that can be shared.
- The deeper lore (full files, details, systems) should live in the Lore Vault section of the website later.
