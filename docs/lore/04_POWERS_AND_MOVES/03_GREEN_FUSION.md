# Green Fusion and the Verdant Seal

Green is the signature mythic moment of Season 1.

## What Green Is

Zaro is Yellow Prime.
ARC-7 is Cyan Prime.

When their energies spiral together at extreme speed,
yellow and cyan merge into **green**.

Green is motion — not magic.

Only Zaro and ARC-7 can create it.

## The Verdant Seal

The Verdant Seal is the Green finishing action.

It:
- forces cosmic fungus out of a space
- stabilizes an area temporarily
- marks a hard-won victory

It does not end all threats.

---

## Support Rule

Mina and Kai assist only by:
- protecting people
- controlling the environment
- buying time

They do not amplify Green.

## Meaning

When Green appears, it means alignment.
Structure and heart are moving as one.
