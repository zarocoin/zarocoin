# ARC-7 — Abilities and Cost

ARC-7 is Cyan Prime.
Built for containment, structure, and restraint.

## Core Abilities

### Scan / Trace
ARC-7 reads motion, patterns, and anomalies.
He detects instability before others can see it.

---

### Containment Field
Geometric cyan constructs that:
- trap
- stabilize
- isolate threats

They are precise and temporary.

---

### Seal
ARC-7’s unique ability.
He seals cracks and prevents spread between realms.

No other character can seal like ARC-7.

---

## Rule Seven

ARC-7 is forbidden from crossing worlds.
The Veil must remain intact.

Breaking this rule creates permanent scars between realms.

---

## Overclock

When ARC-7 pushes beyond safe limits:
- cyan lightning leaks
- movement sharpens
- control weakens

Overclock saves lives — but drains him deeply.

---

## Emotional Conflict

ARC-7 is built for logic.
Zaro introduces emotion into his systems.

That conflict is what causes him to break rules.
