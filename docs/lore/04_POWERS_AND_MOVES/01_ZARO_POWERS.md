# Zaro — Powers and Stamina

Zaro’s power is living spark light.
Warm, emotional, and finite.

## Power States (Visual Life Meter)

Zaro’s color reflects his condition:

- **Bright Yellow** — stable and strong  
- **Dark Yellow** — strained and tired  
- **Gray-Yellow** — near exhaustion  
- **White-Hot Yellow** — rare overdrive surge  

His light never lies.

## Core Abilities

### Spark Shield
A warm yellow barrier used to protect people or small areas.

Holding it drains stamina.

---

### Spark Push
A burst wave that pushes danger away.
Used for escape, rescue, or space control — not destruction.

Large pushes are costly.

---

### Spark Dome
A wide boundary field protecting Zaro’s home.
Its strength mirrors Zaro’s emotional state.

When Zaro weakens, the dome flickers.

---

## Glow Burn (Stamina Crash)

When Zaro overuses his power:
- his color fades
- movement slows
- breathing becomes heavy
- the dome destabilizes

Victory always carries a cost.

## “NOT OVER” Moment

At his lowest point, Zaro can consciously reignite his spark.
This is a mental decision — not rage.

The words **NOT OVER** mark his refusal to collapse.

This surge is powerful, rare, and dangerous.
