# Seed Core and Spark Dust

## Spark Dust

Spark Dust is residue from Zaro’s arrival.
It scatters like faint glitter across the land.

It is:
- not alive
- not dangerous
- a visual clue something changed

---

## The Seed Core

The Seed Core is the most important object in ZaroVerse.

After impact:
- it remains dormant
- Zaro protects it
- he activates it gently with light

It becomes the first tree.

---

## The First Tree

The tree is a stable source of light.
Over time, it produces small glowing seeds.

Zaro does not hoard them.
He protects them.

---

## Theft Logic (Foreshadowed)

Cosmic Fungus steals slowly.
It drains instead of attacking.

Moments of emotional weakness create openings.

## Optional Easter Eggs

Hidden details may appear for attentive fans.
They are never required to understand the story.
