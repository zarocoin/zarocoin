# Cosmic Fungus (The Ink)

## Identity

**Official designation:** Cosmic Fungus  
**Human nickname:** The Ink

The Ink is not a stain.
It is a living invasive force.

It spreads quietly, clings to surfaces, and searches for energy.

---

## Appearance

The Ink may appear as:
- dark smoke
- fog that moves incorrectly
- liquid-black stains
- creeping root-like threads
- thin crawling filaments

It never behaves naturally.

---

## True Nature

Cosmic Fungus is not independent.

It functions as:
- a harvester
- a probe
- a sensory extension

Its signals are felt by something larger.

---

## Relationship to the Black Hole

The Ink is connected to **the Black Hole (K Prime)**.

When the Ink touches a world:
- information flows outward
- attention is drawn inward

The Ink does not conquer.
It **reports**.

## How It Travels

After Zaro’s arrival:
- fragments scatter
- pieces land weak and divided
- growth begins slowly

Earth’s atmosphere breaks it apart, forcing patience.

---

## Behavioral Rules

1. **Spreads like roots**  
   Through cracks, vents, seams, and unseen paths.

2. **Prefers neglect**  
   Grows faster where people do not look.

3. **Drains light**  
   Steals energy instead of attacking directly.

4. **Distorts space and mind**  
   Makes places feel endless, heavy, or wrong.

5. **Learns**  
   Failed paths are avoided next time.

6. **Waits**  
   Becomes aggressive only when defenses weaken.

---

## Threat to Zaro

Zaro’s spark is true light.
The Ink wants it.

When Zaro is tired or emotionally unstable,
the Ink presses closer.

---

## Threat to Humans

The Ink causes:
- fear
- confusion
- wrongness in air and space

It is disturbing, not graphic.
Creepy, not violent.

---

## How It Is Fought (Season 1 Rule)

The Ink can be cleared from a place.
But clearing is never permanent.

Winning space does not end the threat.
