# Threat Escalation States

Cosmic Fungus does not attack at full strength.
It escalates deliberately.

These states help show rising danger without chaos.

---

## State 1 — Trace

- Small stains
- Faint threads
- Easy to miss

---

## State 2 — Observe

- Fungus pauses
- Learns movement patterns
- Watches behavior

---

## State 3 — Spread

- Roots multiply
- Surfaces connect
- Screens show increasing signals

---

## State 4 — Test

- Probes vents and seams
- Presses against barriers
- Searches for weakness

---

## State 5 — Trojan Entry

- Enters protected spaces by hiding
- Uses ordinary objects
- Remains dormant until safe

This must feel believable — never magical.

---

## State 6 — Drain

- Contacts a light source
- Energy dims
- Tug-of-war, not violence

---

## State 7 — Threading

- Thin filaments affect a nervous system
- Movement becomes stiff
- Eyes dull

No gore. No possession theatrics.

---

## State 8 — Clear (Temporary)

- Space is restored
- Threat appears gone
- Silence returns

This state is never final.
