# Trojan and Internal Breach

## The Trojan Principle

The Ink does not need to win loudly.

Sometimes survival is enough.

A fragment that hides can be more dangerous
than a force that attacks.

---

## Trojan Logic

- Tiny pieces evade detection
- Dormant fragments wait
- Travel occurs through proximity

Victory can still carry loss.

---

## Internal Breach (Abstracted)

When a Trojan succeeds:
- alarms resemble earlier warnings
- but the location is wrong

The danger is no longer outside.

It is inside a system thought to be safe.

---

## Visual Language

- Same warning symbols
- Same alarm sounds
- New labels

Subtle root growth behind panels.
Quiet spread.

---

## Narrative Rule

The Trojan is revealed **after apparent victory**.

The audience must believe the threat is over
before learning it has moved.

This rule is never broken.
