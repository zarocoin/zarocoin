# 🤝 ZARO Philanthropy Pledge

**Last Updated:** August 1, 2025  
**Status:** Voluntary Community Commitment  
**Applies To:** ZARO Treasury Usage  
**URL:** https://github.com/zarocoin/zarocoin/tree/main/docs/philanthropy

---

## 📜 Overview

ZARO was launched with a simple principle:  
**Transparency. Fairness. Ethics. Forever.**

From Day 1, we rejected presales, team wallets, and VC allocations.  
Our founder bought at the same price as the public.  
Our liquidity is locked forever.  
Our contract is renounced.  
And our Treasury is untouched — reserved solely for the growth and future of the ecosystem.

But as we grow, we want to give more.

---

## 🎯 The Commitment

If ZARO ever uses a portion of its Treasury in the future — whether for:

- Centralized exchange listings  
- Ecosystem expansion  
- Development or operations  
- Marketing or partner programs  

**Then 5% of the USD value of any tokens used from the Treasury will be allocated to charity.**

This is a **voluntary**, **on-chain-traceable**, and **community-first** pledge.

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Too many projects in crypto enrich a few and leave nothing behind.  
ZARO was born to set a higher standard — not just with transparency, but with purpose.

As ZARO grows, the world should grow with it.

---

## 🧾 Examples

If 10 million ZARO tokens are used from the Treasury when the token price is $0.01:

- Total value used: $100,000  
- **Charity Allocation:** $5,000  
- Proof will be shared publicly, including:
  - Recipient organization
  - Transaction hash
  - USD valuation at time of use

---

## 🏛️ Selection of Causes

We aim to support causes that align with:
- Children’s education  
- Open internet and privacy rights  
- Environmental sustainability  
- Global crisis relief

The community may be consulted on charity selection through on-chain voting or Snapshot polls.

---

## 🔗 Verifiability

All charity transfers will be:
- From a dedicated wallet (TBA)  
- Documented in the [Transparency](https://github.com/zarocoin/zarocoin/tree/main/docs/transparency) section  
- Posted on ZARO’s X account and GitHub

---

## 🚫 What This Is Not

This is not a tax shelter.  
This is not a utility mechanism.  
This is not a securities promise.

It’s simply what the meme space should be:  
**Ethical. Verifiable. Human.**

---

## 📣 Final Note

This pledge is **voluntary**, but public.  
We expect the community to hold us accountable — and we welcome it.

ZARO is here to build a cultural legacy, not just a coin.  
And that legacy must include giving back.

### Solana Extension
ZARO’s bridge expansion to Solana will follow the same 5% philanthropy pledge on any treasury utilization or liquidity deployment.
