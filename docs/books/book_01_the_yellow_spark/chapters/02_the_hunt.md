CHAPTER 2 — THE HUNT

Book 1: The Spark

✦ ✦ ✦

Morning.

Sunlight slices through the trees like bright blades, clean enough to make the forest look honest.

It almost works—until the light hits the leaves.

Spark Dust.

Not glowing. Not magic. Just the faintest glitter residue clinging to bark and moss, catching the sun only at certain angles—appearing, disappearing—like the woods are hiding a secret in plain sight.

Zaro steps out of the house slowly.

He looks hollowed out—teen energy weighed down by a night that didn’t end, only paused. He scans the trees, the ground, the air.

Quiet.

Too quiet.

He exhales, forcing steadiness into his voice.

“Okay. Day two.”

He goes back inside.

The warm lamp still breathes, casting amber light like a living thing. The house feels less abandoned now—more awake. More claimed.

Zaro kneels by the loose floorboard, lifts it, reaches down, and pulls out the small dusty box.

He opens it.

The Seed Core sits inside.

Still dark.

Still silent.

Zaro stares at it, then lifts it toward his face like it might respond to closeness.

“…Seriously?” he mutters. “You’re gonna act dead now?”

He blows gently across its surface.

Nothing.

He blows again—more focused, more stubborn.

Still nothing.

A frown pulls at his face, half annoyed, half scared.

“Come on,” he whispers. “You got me here.”

He raises his hands and lets a thin beam of yellow wash over the Seed Core—soft, careful, like sunlight through curtains.

The Core shivers.

A faint pulse answers.

Rainbow for a split second—like a heartbeat waking up in deep sleep.

Zaro freezes.

“Oh—okay. Okay.”

He adds a little more light, not rushing it, not forcing it.

The rainbow flicker returns… then steadies.

And now the Seed Core does something new.

Inside its glow, a pattern forms—slow, rotating—a ring with three soft points, like a symbol trying to remember itself.

Zaro’s eyes widen.

“…You have a signature.”

Relief hits him so fast it almost makes him laugh. He smiles, real, and leans closer as if the Core can hear him better at short distance.

“You’re alive.”

He whispers to it like he’s talking to a friend he doesn’t want to scare away.

“Alright. Let’s do this together.”

✦ ✦ ✦

Behind the house, the trees grow tighter and the light grows quieter.

Zaro walks to a small patch of earth protected by trunks and shadow, cupping the Seed Core in both hands as if it’s fragile in a way that matters.

He kneels.

He digs with his hands—careful, slow.

This isn’t a chore.

It feels like a vow.

He places the Seed Core into the hole gently.

Covers it with soil.

Patting it down like he’s tucking it in.

Then he holds his hands above the ground.

His glow softens. Steadies.

A slow, measured pulse of warmth radiates into the soil.

The dirt warms.

The ground hums faintly.

Under the surface, a thin glow spreads as if roots are testing the world—touching, listening, deciding.

Zaro holds his breath.

For one second—

nothing.

Then…

a tiny shoot breaks through the dirt.

Small.

Fragile.

Barely there.

It glows faintly, like it’s breathing.

Zaro’s face changes instantly—shock, hope, disbelief colliding.

He laughs under his breath.

“No way…”

He leans closer until his forehead almost touches the air above it.

“Hey,” he whispers. “Hey… you’re really here.”

The shoot trembles in the breeze.

Alive.

Zaro’s voice drops, protective and stunned.

“Okay. I got you.”

✦ ✦ ✦

He clears dead leaves around the tiny shoot and smooths the soil, making a clean circle of ground as if tidiness can become safety.

He drags stones into place, building a boundary.

Not a prison.

A guard line.

He finds a broken fence plank near the house, repairs it with one touch, and plants it upright beside the new growth like a marker—like a warning to anything watching.

He looks around the forest again.

Still alone.

But he doesn’t feel alone.

He murmurs, a teen promising out loud because silence feels like surrender.

“Everyone says you can’t protect anything…”

He glances back at the shoot.

“…but I’m gonna try.”

He gives the shoot one more soft pulse. It glows a little brighter, responding like a living thing recognizing care.

Zaro nods once.

“Good.”

Then he pauses.

Spark Dust glitters faintly on a nearby leaf.

For a split second, the glitter looks… disturbed.

Not scattered. Not brushed away.

Just… breathed on.

Zaro’s shoulders tighten.

He looks into the trees.

Nothing.

He whispers, so low it’s almost a thought.

“…Yeah. I feel you.”

✦ ✦ ✦

Near the forest edge, where the world feels more human, two teens move fast beneath the same sun.

Mina walks with her eyes locked on a tablet feed. A small drone hovers above her, buzzing lightly, correcting position every time a branch tries to claim the air.

Kai follows with a tool bag slung over one shoulder and a home-built magnet rig that looks half engineered, half scavenged. His gloves are bulky at the knuckles—practical, modified, made for handling the kind of forces you don’t get from store-bought toys.

They talk like gamers because it keeps fear from sounding like fear.

Mina smirks at the screen.

“New zone unlocked.”

Kai flicks a small metal screw between his fingers like a habit—catch, spin, catch—as if his brain works better with something rotating.

Mina keeps walking.

“I saw sparkle in the trees yesterday. Real sparkle.”

Kai shrugs without looking up.

“And I saw three people fake UFO videos this week.”

Mina shoots him a look sharp enough to cut.

“This isn’t fake. The whole forest went quiet last night.”

Kai doesn’t answer immediately.

He looks down at the screw.

It trembles slightly in his fingertips.

His face tightens.

“…Okay. That’s weird.”

Mina’s drone feed flickers for half a second, like the camera hates what it’s looking at.

She leans closer, voice turning focused.

“If this is real, I’m mapping it first.”

A translucent overlay blinks on her screen—gone almost as soon as it appears:

ZL-MAP-02

Mina doesn’t notice.

Kai doesn’t notice.

The drone corrects its hover again, buzzing like it’s nervous.

Kai adjusts his tool bag strap.

On the strap tag, faded and barely visible, a printed code catches the sunlight for a beat:

KAI-7A

✦ ✦ ✦

They walk deeper.

Sunlight hits a leaf and it sparkles.

Mina stops so fast the drone overshoots and snaps back into place.

“Hold up.”

Kai glances at the leaf.

“What, glitter?”

Mina squints.

“No… it’s on everything.”

She rubs her fingers along bark.

Fine glitter residue sticks faintly—more like a texture than a substance, like the tree is wearing a film of something that isn’t supposed to exist here.

Kai crouches and scoops a pinch of dirt and dust from the ground.

He pulls out a small pouch of metal dust—iron filings, homemade—and holds it near the glitter residue.

The iron filings twitch.

Not floating.

Not flying.

Just reacting, subtle and undeniable, as if something in the glitter is structured enough to pull on metal without touching it.

Kai’s eyes widen.

“…That’s not normal.”

Mina zooms the drone camera. The glitter pattern shimmers in a way that doesn’t feel like reflection—like it has order. Like it has angles.

Mina whispers, almost reverent without meaning to be.

“That’s not pollen.”

Kai quietly scoops a little glitter residue into a small container and seals it with a click that sounds too loud in the forest.

He keeps his voice low.

“Whatever this is… it likes metal.”

Mina murmurs, staring at the screen.

“Whatever this is… it’s not from here.”

Kai flicks his screw again—faster now—like his thoughts are accelerating.

“…This could be insane.”

✦ ✦ ✦

Deep in shadow, far away from them, the living fog moves.

It creeps low, patient, thickening where the light doesn’t land.

Forest ambience dampens around it.

Crickets soften.

Wind dulls.

Wet-static rises—not a sound so much as a texture, damp electricity rubbed into something wet, layered until it feels intimate.

The fog reaches a patch of Spark Dust glitter on a fallen log.

It doesn’t attack.

It touches.

And slowly… the glitter dims.

A single flake gets pulled inward, absorbed into darkness like a stain drinking light. Not fast. Not violent. Efficient.

One tiny piece disappears.

A sample taken.

The fog shifts direction.

Toward warmth.

Toward the dome that holds.

Toward the new growth that breathes yellow into the ground.

✦ ✦ ✦

Back near the house, Zaro checks the tiny shoot like a worried guardian making sure the world didn’t change when he blinked.

It’s still glowing faintly.

He exhales.

Then the forest shifts.

Not visually.

Audibly.

Wind dulls.

Crickets soften.

The air feels heavier, like the world has gained weight.

Wet-static rises.

Zaro stands instantly.

“…No.”

He moves toward the edge of the house and presses his palm against the dome.

Warm resistance meets him.

Still locked.

Still holding.

But something is pressing from outside.

Not slamming.

Not hitting.

Pressing.

Resting.

Patient.

Like damp stain leaning into glass.

Zaro whispers, voice tight.

“You’re learning.”

He glances at the shoot.

It flickers faintly.

His tone sharpens—teen anger trying to become courage.

“Don’t even look at it.”

He raises both hands and reinforces the dome.

Not a blast.

A steady push.

The dome hums.

Zaro’s glow increases slightly, careful and controlled, like he can feel the edge of his own limits.

He mutters through clenched teeth:

“Not today.”

✦ ✦ ✦

Mina’s drone approaches from far away.

The feed glitches again.

The camera struggles, refusing to settle focus.

Then—

a shimmer in the air.

A faint golden curve, like light bending around something that isn’t supposed to be there.

Mina’s eyes widen.

“…Kai. Look.”

On the screen, the shimmer becomes clearer: a bubble-like distortion, an invisible shell revealed by how the world fails to behave behind it.

A dome.

And behind it…

warm light.

Movement.

A silhouette.

Not human.

Not animal.

Just… something standing inside.

Mina’s throat tightens.

“That’s… a person?”

Kai shakes his head slowly, eyes fixed on the feed.

“No.”

Mina swallows hard.

“…Then what is it?”

The drone zooms closer.

The silhouette inside shifts.

Not like it sees them—like it senses the concept of observation.

Inside the dome, Zaro turns slightly toward the edge.

He doesn’t see them.

But he senses something else outside besides the living fog.

His shoulders tense.

“…Someone’s out there.”

Mina instinctively backs the drone up.

Her hands shake against the controls.

Kai’s voice stays low and steady.

“Steady.”

The wet-static rises again.

Something presses harder.

✦ ✦ ✦

The pressure spikes.

The dome flashes gold.

A ripple blasts outward through the air—so fast it feels like reality skips a frame.

Mina’s drone jolts violently, thrown back as if it hit an invisible wave.

The camera shakes hard.

Mina gasps and fights to keep control.

Kai grabs her arm to steady her, grounding her hands like an anchor.

Inside the dome, Zaro glows brighter.

Sparks crawl along the dome surface like lightning veins—thin lines of gold that appear and vanish, as if the shell is rewriting itself to keep holding.

His face is strained now.

He isn’t shouting.

He’s holding the line.

“Back off…!”

And then—

the tiny shoot pulses.

Not a blast.

A heartbeat.

A faint ring of light spreads outward from the ground.

So subtle Mina and Kai don’t notice it clearly…

but Zaro feels it like a second pulse inside his chest.

His eyes flick down.

He freezes.

“…Wait.”

The pulse touches the dome from inside.

And the dome steadies faster than it should—as if the shell recognizes the shoot’s rhythm and accepts it as reinforcement.

Zaro’s breath catches.

He whispers, stunned, like the realization hurts.

“…You’re connected.”

For a second, Zaro and the shoot sync.

Guardian and source.

The pressure outside eases.

Not defeated.

Not burned.

Interrupted.

The living fog retreats again into shadow.

Patient.

Calm.

Like it learned something new.

Zaro lowers his hands slowly, breathing hard.

He stares at the shoot like it just spoke without sound.

“…Okay.”

He swallows.

“…So you’re not just mine to protect.”

He looks out into the forest, eyes narrowing with a new kind of fear.

“…You’re the reason.”

✦ ✦ ✦

A different realm.

Cold. Clean.

A vast structure floats in silent space—a city made of geometry and teal light, surfaces meeting at perfect angles as if this place refuses improvisation.

Data planes flicker in and out of existence like walls made from information.

ARC-7 stands still at the center of it.

Teal pulses through armor that looks less forged than assembled from rules. His visor is not a face so much as a focused lens.

He watches the dome flare.

He watches the new pulse signature.

An alert forms in sharp, clinical lines:

SIGNATURE: NEW LIGHT SOURCE DETECTED
STATUS: GROWTH EVENT

Then a second warning:

CONTAMINATION PROXIMITY: RISING

ARC-7’s visor brightens by a degree.

“It’s beginning,” he says—not as wonder. As classification.

A system log scrolls quickly—hard to catch, easy to miss:

SEED_EVENT_002
ARC TIME: CYCLE 7.00.02

ARC-7 stands still.

Watching.

Calculating.

But something in his posture shifts—just slightly—like logic is starting to learn the shape of concern.

✦ ✦ ✦

Back in the forest, sunlight fades.

Shadows stretch.

Spark Dust still glitters faintly on leaves and bark like a lingering memory of the crash—appearing only when the angle is right, vanishing when it isn’t.

Near the dome boundary, a darker speck sits in the glitter.

Tiny.

Motionless.

Like a spore sleeping inside shine.

It doesn’t spread yet.

It doesn’t move.

But the air around it feels wrong—quietly heavy, like something waiting for permission.

A faint wet-static whisper flickers once…

then stops.

The forest holds its breath.

✦ ✦ ✦
