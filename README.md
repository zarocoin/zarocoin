## 2. ZaroLand – Real-World Park Brand

**ZaroLand** is the **real-world theme park arm** of ZaroVerse: a nature-integrated family adventure park concept that blends:

- Scenic trails and forest-style paths  
- Light adventure (ziplines, platforms, viewpoints)  
- Character zones featuring ZaroVerse mascots  
- AR treasure hunts and story quests  
- Food, rest, and event areas  
- Merch and collectibles tied to the ZARO IP

The **first ZaroLand site is already secured** and controlled by ZaroVerse.  
Its exact location will be disclosed **after the successful IEO of ZLAND** to avoid a commercial land rush around the site and to preserve strategic flexibility.

## 3. ZLAND – ZaroLand Membership & Utility Token

**ZLAND** is the **global membership, loyalty, and utility token** for ZaroLand.

Think of it as:

> **Airline miles for theme parks.**

ZLAND is used to:

- 🎟 **Reduce ticket costs** (partial payments and discounts)  
- ⚡ **Unlock priority access** and fast-pass style queues  
- ⭐ **Upgrade experiences** (premium tours, night events, special packages)  
- 🍔 **Get perks on food & merch** (discounts, promos, exclusives)  
- 🎭 **Enter exclusive zones & events** (meet-the-mascot, limited shows, AR-only areas)  
- 📱 **Earn rewards via AR quests and app missions**  
- ✈️ **Integrate with travel platforms** (goal: Booking.com, Expedia, Wego, etc., subject to partnerships)

### 3.1 Token Design

ZLAND is designed first and foremost as a **loyalty and membership token** for the ZaroLand ecosystem:

- **Chain at Launch:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC)  
- **Standard:** BEP-20  
- **Ticker:** `ZLAND`  
- **Category:** Membership, loyalty, and utility  

Key design choices:

- 🔁 **Mintable:**  
  ZLAND can be minted over time to support ongoing rewards as parks and user bases grow (similar to airline miles issuance).

- 🧩 **Contract Not Renounced:**  
  Governance and upgrade capability is retained by **ZaroVerse Ltd.** so the loyalty system can evolve, support new parks, and integrate partners safely.

- 🚫 **No Team or Advisor Allocation:**  
  There is no dedicated ZLAND allocation for “team” or “advisors.”  
  Tokens are either:
  - Sold transparently via IEO(s), or  
  - Held in treasury for utility (loyalty rewards, integrations, liquidity, and ecosystem support).
