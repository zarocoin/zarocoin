# ZLAND – ZaroLand Membership & Utility Token

**ZLAND** is the official **membership, loyalty, and utility token** of the **ZaroLand** theme park franchise, issued by **ZaroVerse Ltd. (BVI)**.

It is designed to work much like **airline miles** or **hotel points**, adapted to a global network of nature-integrated adventure parks.

---

## Core Concept

ZLAND is:

- A **rewards currency** that visitors can **earn** through park visits, purchases, and partner bookings.  
- A **utility token** that can be **redeemed** for:
  - Ticket discounts and partial ticket payments  
  - Fast-pass style priority queues  
  - Upgrades to premium experiences and special events  
  - Dining and merchandise perks  
  - Access to exclusive zones, meet-and-greets, and AR experiences  

The long-term vision is for ZLAND to act as a **global membership layer** across:

- All future ZaroLand parks  
- Partner hotels and travel services  
- Online travel agencies (OTAs) and booking platforms

## Travel & Booking Integrations

ZaroVerse intends to integrate ZLAND into major travel and booking ecosystems so that:

- Users can **earn ZLAND** when booking ZaroLand tickets or packages via partners such as Booking.com, Expedia, Wego, and others (subject to partnerships and integration work).  
- Users can **redeem ZLAND** to partially pay for ZaroLand tickets and experiences, similar to redeeming airline miles for flights.

This makes ZLAND useful not only inside the park but also within a broader **travel and tourism context**.

## Token Model

- **Chain at Launch:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC)  
- **Standard:** BEP-20  
- **Ticker:** `ZLAND`  
- **Use Case:** Membership, loyalty, and utility for the ZaroLand ecosystem  

Key design decisions:

- The **contract will not be renounced**.  
- The token will remain **mintable**, under the controlled governance of ZaroVerse Ltd.  
- This is necessary for ZLAND to function like a **long-term loyalty program**, where new tokens can be issued as rewards as the user base and number of parks grow.

There is **no team or advisor allocation**.  
All ZLAND tokens are either:

- Sold in IEOs, or  
- Allocated to treasury for:
  - Loyalty rewards  
  - Ticketing and perks  
  - Ecosystem partnerships  
  - Liquidity provisioning and market-making  
  - Strategic development of the ZaroLand franchise

---

## IEO Overview

- **Initial IEO Allocation:** 15% of the initial supply  
- **IEO Price:** 0.005 USD per ZLAND  
- **Target Raise (First IEO):** 700,000 USD  

A **second IEO** (also 15% at the same price) may be conducted **only if** the first IEO is fully allocated and market demand justifies additional sale before listing. Otherwise, that allocation remains in treasury for utility and future ecosystem growth.
