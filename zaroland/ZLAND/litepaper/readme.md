## 1. What Is ZaroLand?

**ZaroLand** is a new, nature-integrated family adventure park brand created by **ZaroVerse Ltd.**  

Each ZaroLand park is designed as a place where families can:

- Walk through scenic trails and forest-like paths  
- Enjoy light adventure experiences such as ziplines and platforms  
- Meet the ZaroVerse characters in themed zones  
- Discover stories and quests using AR and mobile apps  
- Eat, relax, shop, and attend seasonal events  

The **first ZaroLand site is already secured** and under ZaroVerse’s control.  

- It is located in a **beautiful, naturally rich area**, ideal for outdoor experiences.  
- Exact coordinates and surrounding land details will be disclosed **after the successful IEO** of ZLAND to avoid a commercial race for adjacent land.  

ZaroLand will be rolled out as a **global franchise**, with multiple parks in different regions over time.

## 2. Why Does ZaroLand Need a Token?

Traditional theme parks and travel companies use **loyalty programs**:

- Airline miles  
- Hotel points  
- Closed, centralized reward systems  

They are powerful, but:

- Each brand runs its own system with limited interoperability.  
- Points are not transparent and rarely portable.  
- Users have little insight into how points are issued and managed.

**ZLAND** brings this logic into Web3, with a focus on **real-world usage**:

> ZLAND is a **global membership, loyalty, and utility token** for ZaroLand – similar in spirit to airline miles, but for a network of adventure parks and travel partners.

---

## 3. What Is ZLAND?

**ZLAND** is the official token of the ZaroLand ecosystem.

It is designed to:

- Work like **membership points** for ZaroLand parks  
- Be **earned** when you interact with ZaroLand and partners  
- Be **redeemed** for real benefits and experiences  

ZLAND is **not** a speculative DeFi token.  
Its purpose is **utility and loyalty**, not financial yield.

### Core Roles of ZLAND

- **Membership Layer**  
  Your ZLAND balance reflects your relationship with ZaroLand: visits, spending, and engagement.

- **Rewards Currency**  
  Earn ZLAND through tickets, purchases, quests, and travel partners.

- **Utility Token**  
  Spend ZLAND for discounts, perks, upgrades, and access across parks and partners.

ZaroVerse plans to integrate ZLAND with major **online travel agencies (OTAs)** and booking platforms, such as:

The goal:

Hotels and travel partners may also:

- Reward ZLAND for certain bookings.

For non-crypto users, this can all be handled via **simple, custodial accounts** inside booking platforms or the ZaroLand app.  
Advanced users can take ZLAND to self-custody wallets if they wish.

## 5. Token Design & Economics

### 5.1 Basic Parameters

- **Name:** ZaroLand Token  
- **Ticker:** `ZLAND`  
- **Standard:** BEP-20 (BNB Smart Chain)  
- **Category:** Membership, loyalty, and utility token  
- **Issuer:** ZaroVerse Ltd. (BVI)  

### 5.2 Mintable, Non-Renounced Contract

ZLAND is **mintable** and the contract will **not be renounced**.  

This is deliberate and core to the design:

- ZLAND behaves more like **airline miles** than a fixed-supply coin.  
- As more visitors and parks come online, more ZLAND may need to be issued as rewards.  
- ZaroVerse must retain the ability to:
  - Adjust issuance rates  
  - Support new parks and partners  
  - Maintain a healthy loyalty economy over many years  

All of this is done under the governance of **ZaroVerse Ltd.** using **multi-signature (multi-sig)** controls and clear internal policies.

### 5.3 Initial Supply & IEO

- **Initial Minted Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ZLAND (1 billion)  

**First IEO**

- **Allocation:** 15% (150,000,000 ZLAND)  
- **IEO Price:** 0.005 USD per ZLAND  
- **Target Raise:** 700,000 USD  

**Optional Second IEO**

- **Allocation:** 15% (150,000,000 ZLAND)  
- **IEO Price:** 0.005 USD per ZLAND  
- Only conducted if:
  - The first IEO sells out, and  
  - Market demand justifies additional sale **before listing**.  

If the second IEO is not conducted, this allocation remains in the **treasury** for utilities and growth.

### 5.4 No Team or Advisor Allocation

There is **no dedicated allocation** for:

- Team  
- Advisors  
- Discounted private rounds  

All tokens are either:

- Sold in IEOs, or  
- Held in treasury for:
  - Loyalty rewards  
  - Integrations and partnerships  
  - DEX/CEX liquidity and market-making  
  - Future ZaroLand expansions

### 5.5 Treasury Use

Treasury-held ZLAND is used to:

- Reward visitors and early adopters  
- Power promotions and loyalty campaigns  
- Support ecosystem partners (hotels, OTAs, etc.)  
- Provide liquidity on exchanges  
- Support future ZaroLand parks globally
