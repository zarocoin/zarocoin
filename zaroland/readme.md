# ZaroLand

**ZaroLand** is the real-world, nature-integrated theme park brand being developed by **ZaroVerse Ltd. (BVI)**.

It is designed as a **family-friendly adventure and experience park**, combining:

- Scenic walking trails and nature paths  
- Light adventure activities such as ziplines and platforms  
- Character zones featuring the ZaroVerse mascots (e.g. ZARO)  
- AR-enhanced treasure hunts and story experiences  
- Food courts, rest areas, and event spaces  
- Merch and collectible shops  

The **first ZaroLand site is already secured** and under ZaroVerse’s control.  
However, the exact location will only be announced **after the successful IEO** of the ZLAND token to prevent a commercial race for surrounding land and to preserve strategic flexibility. What can be shared today is that the area is:

- Naturally beautiful  
- Well suited for outdoor, family-oriented experiences  
- Large enough to support a phased park rollout  
- Positioned to become a flagship destination in the ZaroVerse ecosystem  

ZaroLand is built to be:

- **Nature-integrated** – preserving and working around existing trees, slopes, and views  
- **Modular** – expandable in carefully planned phases  
- **Story-driven** – connected to the broader ZaroVerse characters and lore  
- **Globally scalable** – a model that can be replicated in multiple countries

## Relationship to ZaroVerse

ZaroLand is a key physical anchor of the wider **ZaroVerse**:

- ZaroVerse builds and manages the IP, mascots, media, games, and Web3 infrastructure.  
- ZaroLand brings that IP into the real world through parks and physical experiences.  
- The **ZLAND token** provides the **membership, loyalty, and utility** layer connecting visitors, parks, and partners globally.

For more details about the ZaroVerse ecosystem and the ZARO token, see the main project documentation in this repository.

## ZLAND – ZaroLand’s Global Membership Token

To support the ZaroLand franchise, ZaroVerse is introducing **ZLAND**:

> ZLAND is a **global membership, loyalty, and utility token** for all ZaroLand parks – conceptually similar to airline miles, but for a network of adventure parks.

ZLAND is used for:

- Ticket discounts and partial payments  
- Priority access and fast-pass style queue privileges  
- Upgrades and premium experiences  
- Dining and merchandise perks  
- Access to exclusive zones, events, and AR experiences  
- Cross-park membership and rewards across future ZaroLand locations  

ZLAND is **mintable** and the contract will **not be renounced**, by design – the token must function like a modern loyalty program where users can continue to **earn** and **redeem** rewards over time.
